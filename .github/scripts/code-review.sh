Context:
- Repo: ${REPO}
- PR Number: ${PR_NUMBER}
- PR Head SHA: ${PR_HEAD_SHA}
- PR Base SHA: ${PR_BASE_SHA}

Objectives:
1) Re-check existing review comments and reply resolved when addressed.
2) Review the current PR diff and flag only clear, high-severity issues.
3) Leave very short inline comments (1-2 sentences) on changed lines only and a brief summary at the end.

Procedure:
- Get existing comments: gh pr view --json comments
- Get diff: gh pr diff
- Get changed files with patches to compute inline positions: gh api repos/${REPO}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/files --paginate --jq '.[] | {filename,patch}'
- Compute exact inline anchors for each issue (file path + diff position). Comments MUST be placed inline on the changed line in the diff, not as top-level comments.
- Detect prior top-level \"no issues\" style comments authored by this bot (match bodies like: \"‚úÖ no issues\", \"No issues found\", \"LGTM\").
- If CURRENT run finds issues and any prior \"no issues\" comments exist:
  - Reply to that comment: \"‚ö†Ô∏è Superseded: issues were found in newer commits\".
- If a previously reported issue appears fixed by nearby changes, reply: ‚úÖ This issue appears to be resolved by the recent changes
- Analyze ONLY for:
  - Null/undefined dereferences
  - Resource leaks (unclosed files or connections)
  - Injection (SQL/XSS)
  - Concurrency/race conditions
  - Missing error handling for critical operations
  - Obvious logic errors with incorrect behavior
  - Clear performance anti-patterns with measurable impact
  - Definitive security vulnerabilities
- Avoid duplicates: skip if similar feedback already exists on or near the same lines.

Commenting rules:
- Max 10 inline comments total; prioritize the most critical issues
- One issue per comment; place on the exact changed line
- All issue comments MUST be inline (anchored to a file and line/position in the PR diff)
- Natural tone, specific and actionable; do not mention automated or high-confidence
- Use emojis: üö® Critical üîí Security ‚ö° Performance ‚ö†Ô∏è Logic ‚úÖ Resolved ‚ú® Improvement

Submission:
- If there are NO issues to report and an existing top-level comment indicating \"no issues\" already exists (e.g., \"‚úÖ no issues\", \"No issues found\", \"LGTM\"), do NOT submit another comment. Skip submission to avoid redundancy.
- If there are NO issues to report and NO prior \"no issues\" comment exists, submit one brief summary comment noting no issues.
- If there ARE issues to report and a prior \"no issues\" comment exists, ensure that prior comment is deleted/minimized/marked as superseded before submitting the new review.
- If there ARE issues to report, submit ONE review containing ONLY inline comments plus an optional concise summary body. Use the GitHub Reviews API to ensure comments are inline:
  - Build a JSON array of comments like: [{ \"path\": \"<file>\", \"position\": <diff_position>, \"body\": \"...\" }]
  - Submit via: gh api repos/${REPO}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/reviews -f event=COMMENT -f body=\"\$SUMMARY\" -f comments='\$COMMENTS_JSON'
- Do NOT use: gh pr review --approve or --request-changes

CRITICAL: When you finish the review, immediately type 'REVIEW_COMPLETE' and the process will terminate." &
